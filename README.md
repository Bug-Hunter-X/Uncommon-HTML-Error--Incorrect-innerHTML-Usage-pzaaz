This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in HTML related to the misuse of the `innerHTML` property. Incorrectly using `innerHTML` to insert complete HTML elements can cause issues, making the DOM inconsistent or opening security vulnerabilities.  The `bug.html` file shows the problem, while `bugSolution.html` offers a corrected approach.  The solution demonstrates proper DOM manipulation techniques.
